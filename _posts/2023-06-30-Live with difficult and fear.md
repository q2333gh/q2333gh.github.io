I’m glad you know Descartes’ scientific methodology, which is a useful way to approach complex problems and seek the truth.  
However, I understand that sometimes you may encounter difficulties that make you feel afraid or discouraged.  
That’s normal, and many people have similar feelings  
you don’t have to let fear stop you from **pursuing your goals and interests**

# aware,觉察 : measure the fear and frastration level

You need to learn how to manage your fear and use it as a catalyst(催化剂) for growth and change.  
Learn **is** a process definnately with challenges.

## Change the view-do:

**reframe your fear**.  
 Instead of seeing fear as a negative or threatening emotion, try to consider it as a positive or helpful one.  
 For example, instead of thinking “I’m afraid of failing this project, think “I’m excited about showing what I can contribute to this project”.  
 Instead of thinking “I’m afraid of speaking in front of the people”, think “I’m excited about share my ideas and curious about what the people thinks of my presentation”.  
 By changing your **perspective**, you can change your **emotional response** and reduce your **anxiety**.  
**view:use positive affirmations**.  
 These are statements that you say to yourself or write down that express your confidence and ability to overcome your fears.  
 “I have overcome many difficulties before and I can do it again”.  
 By repeating these affirmations, you can boost your self-esteem and self-efficacy, and create a positive mindset.

eats: **tryptophan** Vitamin.D, omega-3 ( vitamin-D and omega-3 fatty acids may modulate(调节) the creation, release, and function of serotonin.)

VD->sunlights: at least **15 minutes of exposure to natural light every day**, preferably in the morning or afternoon

Exercising mechinism:
trigger the*release* of tryptophan into yourblood and _reduce_ the number of otheramino acids. This creates an idealenvironment for more tryptophan toreach your brain and increaseserotonin levels

branched chain amino acids (BCAAs)  _compete with tryptophan_ for transport into the brain,

what level of excise will achive the goal of produceaffective tryptophan ?  
Generally, **moderate to vigorous exercise for atleast 20 minutes can have a significant effect ontryptophan levels**
