# bytecode 字节码

pros:
	A compromise between target machine code and  interpreter solution.
	1.VM-oriented. means good cross-platform  compability
	2. speed: machine-code > bytecode > inteprete 

 techs being developed base on bytecode :
 1.cache for hot code ->machine code ,(hot means conde snippets use more often) -> JIT 
 2.cache for all code ->AOT ,but machine-code quality
less good (than what ?)

concepts recall:
	compiled type: complile all file to machine-code.
	like DB field materialized-model procedure.
	interpreted type: compile and run line by line .
	like DB field volcano-model.
