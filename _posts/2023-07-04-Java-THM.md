# bytecode 字节码

pros:
	A compromise between target machine code and  interpreter solution:
	1.VM-oriented:(Architecture neutral(中立)) offers a good cross-platform  compatibility.
	2. speed: machine-code > bytecode > inteprete 

 techs gradually developed base on bytecode :
 1. cache for hot code ->machine code ,(hot means conde snippets use more often) -> JIT 
 2. all compiled machine-code ->AOT ,but machine-code quality
less good (than what ?maybe lack of optimize?)

concepts recall:
	compiled type: compile all file to machine-code.
	like DB field materialized-model procedure.
	interpreted type: compile and run line by line .
	like DB field volcano-model.

## Reflection 反射
concept: let any code snippets get any object\`s data structure and functions.
base on this , can we somehow dynamically let program user create a class at running time ?


## Serialize 序列化
serialize concepts: convert an object to byte-sequence or
convert an object to JSON,XML.....
deserialize : commonly , convert a JSON to an object.

usage:
	1.cross-programming-laguage procedure call. (RPC)
	 2.network transport 
	 3.create object from IO(disk,network)
todo: whats the basic impl of serialize ? to what kind of byte-sequence?
anything could be called byte-sequence.


## Code-Robustness : Exception

Throwable:
	Error:
		 VM-Error
			Stack Overflow
			Out of Memory
	Exception:
			IO Exception:
					EOF(End Of File) 文件越界
					FileNotFound
					NotHavePermission (R or W or R\\W)
			RuntimeException:
					Arithmetic
					ClassNotFound
					IllegalArgument
					ArrayIndexOutOfBound

					**NullPointer**				


## Multi-Thread Communication

Basic Approach:
Mutex: 互斥锁
	实现:syncronized 关键词
	
	

## Java file IO



## Java  network IO
