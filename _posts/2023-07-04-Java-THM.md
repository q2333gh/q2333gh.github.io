# bytecode 字节码

pros:
	A compromise between target machine code and  interpreter solution.
	1.VM-oriented:(Architecture neutral(中立)) offers a good cross-platform  compatibility.
	2. speed: machine-code > bytecode > inteprete 

 techs being developed base on bytecode :
 1.cache for hot code ->machine code ,(hot means conde snippets use more often) -> JIT 
 2.cache for all code ->AOT ,but machine-code quality
less good (than what ?)

concepts recall:
	compiled type: compile all file to machine-code.
	like DB field materialized-model procedure.
	interpreted type: compile and run line by line .
	like DB field volcano-model.

## Reflection 反射
concept: let any code snippets get any object\`s data structure and functions.
base on this , can we somehow dynamically let program user create a class at running time ?


## Serialize 序列化
serialize concepts: convert an object to byte-sequence or
convert an object to JSON,XML.....
deserialize : commonly , convert a JSON to an object.

usage:
	1.cross-programming-laguage procedure call.
	 2.network transport
	 3.create object from IO(disk,network)
