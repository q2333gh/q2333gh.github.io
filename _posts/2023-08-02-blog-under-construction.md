## optional

github pages workflow  
everytime i push to remote-git .  
the github will automatic build the github-jekyll-pages,  
but it takes about 100s to build . maybe somehow optimize the time

1.add visitors record,  
2.free to leave a msg.

I have some notes locally .  
 wait to upload to The Internet~  
That will be a cool thing:
the notes include:
CS tech, society,humanity,personal growth,history, and all the intersting facts and thoughts worth to check it out!  
but some of it is format of xmind. need convert to docx and then convert to .md with file and jekyll .md format info.  
now still trying to make this workflow automatic to a program with scripts.

Once these notes is tracked by git , that will be a great thing~ I love it !

I\`m learning the style same like https://xxchan.me/ her blog-website. (from the best teacher~)
