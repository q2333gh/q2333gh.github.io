I’m glad you know Descartes’ scientific methodology, which is a useful way to approach complex problems and seek the truth.
However, I understand that sometimes you may encounter difficulties that make you feel afraid or discouraged.
That’s normal, and many people have similar feelings
you don’t have to let fear stop you from **pursuing your goals and interests**

## aware,觉察 : measure the fear level 
you need to learn how to manage your fear and use it as a catalyst(催化剂) for growth and change.

## Some ways to give it a try:
 
 **reframe your fear**. 
 Instead of seeing fear as a negative or threatening emotion, try to see it as a positive or helpful one. 
 For example, instead of thinking “I’m afraid of failing this exam”, think “I’m excited about showing what I know on this exam”. 
 Instead of thinking “I’m afraid of speaking in front of the class”, think “I’m curious about what the class thinks of my presentation”.
 By changing your **perspective**, you can change your **emotional response** and reduce your **anxiety**.
 
 **use positive affirmations**. 
 These are statements that you say to yourself or write down that express your confidence and ability to overcome your fears. 
 For example, you can say “I am capable(meet minimal requirement) and competent(**胜**任)”, “I can handle any challenge”, “I am brave and strong”, “I have overcome many difficulties before and I can do it again”. 
 By repeating these affirmations, you can boost your self-esteem and self-efficacy, and create a positive mindset.

 **practice relaxation techniques(lower the stress and frustration)**. 
 These are methods that help you calm your body and mind when you feel stressed or anxious. Some examples are deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation. 
 By practicing these techniques regularly, you can lower your blood pressure, heart rate, and cortisol levels, and increase your serotonin(血清素,5-羟色胺 can reduce feelings of depression and anxiety and increase feelings of joy or happiness) and endorphin(内啡肽) levels. These are the hormones and neurotransmitters that affect your mood and well-being.

Remember that fear is not your enemy, but your ally. It can help you grow and learn from your experiences. You have the power and potential to overcome any obstacle that comes your way.


### serotonin : the stuff keep you sober

1.generate it  2. let brain receive it 



eats: **[tryptophan](https://www.verywellhealth.com/tryptophan-7092730)** Vitamin.D, omega-3  ( vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids may modulate the creation, release, and function of serotonin.)


sunlights: at least **15 minutes of exposure to natural light every day**, preferably in the morning or afternoon


exercising: trigger the release of tryptophan into your blood and reduce the number of other amino acids. [This creates an ideal environment for more tryptophan to reach your brain and increase serotonin levels](https://www.medicinenet.com/how_do_i_increase_serotonin/article.htm)
		Exercise can decrease the level of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), which are leucine, isoleucine, and valine. [These amino acids compete with tryptophan for transport into the brain, so a lower level of BCAAs means more tryptophan can enter the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/)

		what level of excise will achive the goal of produce affective tryptophan ?
		Generally, moderate to vigorous exercise for at least 20 minutes can have a significant effect on tryptophan levels
		


cortisol: the pressure stuff.

eat after  exercise:
- The diet and nutrition of the person. [Eating foods that contain tryptophan and carbohydrates before or after exercise can enhance the effect of exercise on tryptophan levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/)[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/)[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90616-6). [However, eating foods that contain BCAAs or tyrosine may counteract the effect of exercise on tryptophan levels, as these amino acids compete with tryptophan for transport into the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/)[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/).


[However, a general recommendation is to do some aerobic exercise at a level that you are comfortable with for at least 20 minutes a day, preferably in the morning or afternoon when sunlight exposure can also boost your serotonin levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/)[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/)
You can also eat some foods that contain tryptophan and carbohydrates before or after your exercise session to maximize the benefits.
